                var
                var is a global or Functional Scoped
                var can be reassigned
                var can be redeclared
                var can be modified later


                var a=10;
                var a=20;
                console.log(a);
                
                
                Let
                Let  is a Block  Scoped
                let cannot be reassigned
                let cannot  be redeclared
                let can be modified later
                
                let a=10;
                let a=20;    we cannot redeclare, but we can modify like a=20;
                console.log(a);  
                
                Const
                Const   is a Block  Scoped
                const cannot be reassigned
                Const cannot  be redeclared
                Const  cannot  be modified later

                Hoisting

                Hoisting is a default Javascript Mechanism where our variables and Functions declarations
                are moved to top of their Scope before code execution ,only declrations are hoisted not 
                intilazations.

                console.log(a);
                var a = 5;

                Temporal Dead Zone

                It is the time between the hoisting and the initialization of variables. 

                let b; 
                console.log(b); 
                b = "Food";
                
            </pre>
            </div>
        </div>
